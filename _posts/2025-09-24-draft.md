Setting up a WireGuard VPN for privacy and security involves setting up both server and client side systems. This guide explains how to set up a client side Linux system - with or without [Pi-hole DNS filtering](https://pi-hole.net/) on the home network - and then configure the system so that WireGuard settings will switch depending on if the client system is on the home network or not. This is necessary because the WireGuard client will ruin your network connection if you are on your home network, and there is no need to manually switch your VPN client on and off when automation exists.

Guide assumes a WireGuard VPN server is set up, and port forwarding is configured on the home router. Guide is also written for Linux Mint - while this should also work for most Debian systems, you may need to modify some filepaths depending on your distro.

## Background

## Prerequesites

## Client Setup

### SSH Key Generation

This should be familiar (for general server access, not WireGuard-specific handshakes), but direction is provided below just in case. On the client, run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
```

Hit enter twice - use default location and no passkey (unless you really want one).

There are two ways to copy your key to the server, the Easy Way and the More Likely Way.

#### The Easy Way:

The easy way only works if your client can access the server. Since we are generating keys, you should probably have password authentication enabled for SSH. In case you forgot, you modify these lines in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
```bash
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin no
```

Then on the client side you can simply run:
```bash
ssh-copy-id username@server-ip
```

</div>
<div class="col-md-6">

#### The More Likely Way:

Run this on the client:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Get this clipboard item to the server however you like, probbaly using another system that does have SSH access, and append it to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

### Installation

Run on the client:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wireguard resolvconf
```

Once that is done, generate WireGuard keys (these are different than SSH keys - the former are needed to access the WireGuard server at all for configuration):

```bash
cd /etc/wireguard
sudo umask 077
sudo wg genkey | sudo tee privatekey | sudo wg pubkey | sudo tee publickey
```

Next, create the WireGuard config file on your client using:
```bash
sudo vim /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

And insert:
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = # Paste the contents of /etc/wireguard/privatekey here
Address = 10.0.0.2/24
DNS = 1.1.1.1

[Peer]
PublicKey = # Your server's public key goes here.
Endpoint = your-server-ip:51820
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```
Note that you have three items to fill in above. You will need the PublicKey from the server, not from what you have here on the client. So hold off on that for now.

Private key on the client can be acquired using:
```bash
sudo cat /etc/wireguard/privatekey
```

The public key on the client (which will be needed on the server) can be acquired using:
```bash
sudo cat /etc/wireguard/publickey
```

Now SSH into the WireGuard server and edit the WireGuard config using:
```bash
sudo vim /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

Append the following to the file:
```
[Peer]
PublicKey = # Paste your client's public key here.
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
```
For `AllowedIPs`, you will need to increment the 2. For my setup, the server was .1, and I had two previous clients taking up .2 and .3, so I appended it as .4.

Back on the client, edit the client's WireGuard config using:
```bash
sudo vim /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

Remember how we didn't have the server's public key last time? Fix that now:
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = # Paste(d) the contents of /etc/wireguard/privatekey here
Address = 10.0.0.2/24
DNS = 1.1.1.1

[Peer]
PublicKey = # Your server's public key goes here.
Endpoint = your-server-ip:51820
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

Three items to check, above. Make sure the `Address` on your client side matches `AllowedIps` on the server side.

### Dual Wireguard Configurations

If you start WireGuard on your home network now, it will fail. You need to configure something that will turn it off when you are on your home network. Fortunately, we have good tools for this.

On your client side, run:
```
sudo cp /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0-away.conf
sudo cp /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0-home.conf
```

Create the home configuration using:
```bash
sudo vim /etc/wireguard/wg0-home.conf
```

The only change you need to make below is to AllowedIPs: `10.0.0.0/24` is critical here, and target your Pi-Hole for the DNS server if you have a Pi-Hole routing DNS traffic on your home network. Also don't forget to adjust `Address` if needed.
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = # Your laptop's private key.
Address = 10.0.0.2/32
DNS = 1.1.1.1 # Or 192.168.1.xxx for Pi-Hole.

[Peer]
PublicKey = # Your server's public key.
Endpoint = your-server-local-ip:51820
AllowedIPs = your-local-ip/24
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

Away config should be edited using:
```bash
sudo vim /etc/wireguard/wg0-away.conf
```

And should contain:
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = # Your laptop's private key.
Address = 10.0.0.2/32
DNS = 1.1.1.1 # Or 192.168.1.xxx for Pi-Hole.

[Peer]
PublicKey = # Your server's public key.
Endpoint = your-server-external-ip:51820
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```
Note for above, you need your server's external IP. This will be your home router's IP, port forwarded to your VPN server. This was likely set up when the WIreGuard server was set up, and you only need a service like [this](https://whatismyip.com) to check your external IP.

These two `wg0-*` scripts will replace wg0.conf dynamically depending on what network the client is on. This will be triggered by the detection script, which we will now build.

### Detection Script

Run:
```bash
sudo vim /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-wireguard-auto
```

Add the following, adjusting the `HOME_*` values as needed:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script:   99-wireguard-switch
# Purpose:  Automatically switch WireGuard configs based on network location.
#           Triggers when it detects network switch, and checks if home or away.
# Location: /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-wireguard-switch

        if [ "$current_status" = "active" ]; then
            # Check if using away config (away config has AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0).
            if grep -q "AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0" /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf 2>/dev/null; then

                    systemctl start wg-quick@wg0

            else
                log_message "Already using home VPN config."

            if copy_config "/etc/wireguard/wg0-home.conf"; then
                systemctl start wg-quick@wg0

        fi
    else
        log_message "Detected external network."
        current_status=$(get_wg_status)
        
        if [ "$current_status" = "active" ]; then
            # Check if we're using the home config (home config has restricted AllowedIPs).
            if grep -q "AllowedIPs = 192.168.1.0/24" /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf 2>/dev/null; then
                log_message "Switching to away VPN config."
                systemctl stop wg-quick@wg0
                if copy_config "/etc/wireguard/wg0-away.conf"; then
                    systemctl start wg-quick@wg0
                fi
            else
                log_message "Already using away VPN config."
            fi
        else
            log_message "Starting away VPN config."
            if copy_config "/etc/wireguard/wg0-away.conf"; then
                systemctl start wg-quick@wg0
            fi
        fi
    fi
elif [ "$ACTION" = "down" ]; then
    # Uncomment the next line if wireguard should stop when network goes down.
    # systemctl stop wg-quick@wg0
    log_message "Network disconnected."
fi

exit 0
```

Once complete, make it executable:
```bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-wireguard-auto
```

Then, add the following (adjust DNS  IP ad needed) using:
```bash
sudo vim /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-wireguard-dns.sh
```

Add:
```
#!/bin/bash

INTERFACE=$1
ACTION=$2

if [[ "$INTERFACE" == "wg0" && "$ACTION" == "up" ]]; then
    # Set Pi-hole as DNS server for WireGuard interface.
    resolvectl dns wg0 192.168.1.223 # Change! Pi-Hole DNS address or 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1 (Cloudflare) or 9.9.9.9 149.112.112.112 (Quad9)
    resolvectl domain wg0 "~."
    
    # Remove default route from WiFi interface to prioritize VPN DNS.
    resolvectl default-route <replace-me> false
    
    # Ensure only VPN has default route for DNS.
    resolvectl default-route wg0 true
    
    # Flush DNS cache to apply changes.
    resolvectl flush-caches
    
    logger "WireGuard DNS configured: Pi-hole via VPN with WiFi DNS disabled."
fi
```
To know what to enter in `<replace-me>`, run `ip link show`. You need your actual WiFI interface name.

Make it executable:
```
sudo chmod +x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-wireguard-dns.sh
```

To finalize, restart WireGuard on both machines. For the server first, run:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart wg-quick@wg0
```

For the client, run:
```bash
sudo resolvectl default-route wlp4s0 false
sudo systemctl restart wg-quick@wg0
```
This restarts WireGuard and fixes the initial VPN prioritization issue. Some Linux queries might go through your ISP's DNS instead of the proper tunnel due to how systemd-resolve handles queries.

### Troubleshooting

Check that everything is running properly. If Pi-Hole is running, execute the following to verify that it is blocking ad servers (skip if no Pi-Hole is involved):
```bash
nslookup doubleclick.net
nslookup googleadservices.com
```
With Pi-Hole it should return `0.0.0.0`.

#### If DNS is not working with Pi-Hole

Check if Pi-hole is reachable:
```bash
ping 192.168.1.223
```

Verify the DNS script ran:
```bash
journalctl -u NetworkManager -f
```

Restart systemd-resolved:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

#### VPN connects, but no internet

Check routing:
```bash
ip route show
```
